### What are the incredible features of Goblin?
Goblin is the first non-profiling, single-trace timing SCA that successfully extracts the user's input, which, by definition, should have been kept secret.

### Available code:
To use Goblin, please refer to our GitHub repository: [Goblin package](https://github.com/vernamlab/Goblin)

### How easy is it to use Goblin, and how scalable is Goblin?
Goblin is machine-learning assisted in disclosing the garbler's input, regardless of size. For this purpose, k-means clustering is applied, where no manual tuning or heuristic leakage models are needed. It is, of course, advantageous to the attacker and allows for scalable and efficient attacks.

### Which garbled circuit optimizations are vulnerable to Goblin?
The free-XOR- and half-gates-optimized constructions are vulnerable to Goblin attack.

### Why free-XOR- and half-gates-optimized constructions are vulnerable to Goblin?
The existence of these unbalanced IFs demonstrates the likelihood of timing attacks to be successfully mounted against them.

### How did we examine the possibility of mounting timing SCA against GC frameworks?
To examine this, SC-Eliminator \[1] is applied against TinyGarble \[2], JustGarble \[3], EMP-toolkit \[4], Obliv-C \[5], and ABY \[6], and here is the leaky IF reports:

| Framework                  | IF |
| :------------------------- | :-: |
| TinyGarble [2] (half-gate) |  4 |
| TinyGarble [2] (free-XOR)  |  7 |
| JustGarble [3]             | 11 |
| EMP-toolkit [4]            |  0 |
| Obliv-c [5]                |  4 |
| ABY [6]                    |  0 |
